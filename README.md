# sales-predictions
Sales data have been collected for food products sold across outlets of a certain retailer in differenct cities. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model and forecast the sales of each food product at a particular outlet. Using this data analysis model, the retailer will be able to visualize the properties of their products and the number of products they are going to need in response to expected demands so that they can further boost sales at the outlets which perfom well or design the best marketing strategies to increase sales at outlets which experience slowing sales. Consequently, the system will help them make well-informed decisions to increase profits and minimize costs.
Just like many data projects, I will proceed with these three steps:
1. Data cleaning
2. Predictive modeling 
3. Visualization
