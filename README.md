# sales-predictions
Sales data have been collected for food products across outlets of a certain retail company in differenct cities. The aim of this project is to build a predictive model and forecast the sales of each food product at a particular outlet. Using this data analysis model, the company will be able to visualize the properties of their products and the 
sales performance of each store outlet so that they can make well-informed decisions to increase productivity and boost their sales or design best marketing strategies to increase sales at stores which experience slowing sales.
