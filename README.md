# sales-predictions
Sales data have been collected for food products sold across outlets of a certain retail company in differenct cities. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model and forecast the sales of each food product at a particular outlet. Using this data analysis model, the retail company will be able to visualize the properties of their products and the sales performance of each store so that they can make well-informed decisions to increase productivity and further boost their sales or design the best marketing strategies to increase sales at stores which experience slowing sales.
