# sales-predictions
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model and forecast the sales of each product at a particular outlet. It is based on historical sales data which were collected for 1559 products sold across 10 stores located in different cities. Using this predictive model, retailers will be able to visualize the properties of their products and the number of products they are going to need in response to expected demands so that they can further boost sales at the outlets which perfom better or design the best marketing strategies to increase sales at outlets which experience slowing sales. Consequently, the system will help them make well-informed decisions to increase profits and minimize costs.

Just like many data analysis projects, I will proceed with these three steps:
1. Data exploration 
2. Data cleaning
3. Data visualization
4. Feature engineering and predictive modeling 
5. Checking model performance 
6. Conclusion
